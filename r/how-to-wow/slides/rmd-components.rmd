# Components of a `RMarkdown` file

**A (optional) YAML header**

* Defines metadata, such as the title, author and date
* Defines the output format (Word, PDF, HTML, etc.)

**Code chunks: R code chunks**

* This is where the core computation happens
* Can choose to show the underlying code or just the results

**Text with inline code** 

* Great for presenting results as part of a sentence

**(Optional) References**
