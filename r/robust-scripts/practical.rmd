## How to make an R script robust: pratical

In this practical, we will improve the robustness
of the script shown below. 

The script ...

```{r}
## script ...
```

### Problem 1
Add comments to the script to explain:
1. What the script does
2. What inputs are expected
3. What outputs are expected
4. What errors could be generated
5. What different sections of the script are doing

### Problem 2
Add assertions to the script so that any error 
will cause an assertion to fail.

### Problem 3
Use `tryCatch()` to the script so that any errors
will be "caught".
